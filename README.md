# CACC_ACC_MODEL_AIMSUN

AIMSUN Plug in for simulating CACC and ACC's impacts on traffic flow. The base car following model was developed based on Newell model and Gipps model. The lane change model was extended based on Yeo Hwasoo's model. The ACC and CACC models are implemented based on experimental data presented in Vicent's papers (see References).
